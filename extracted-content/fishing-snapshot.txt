  - paragraph: Game fish are fish pursued by recreational anglers. The term can refer to freshwater or saltwater fish. Game fish can be eaten after being caught. The species of fish pursued by anglers varies with geography. Some fish are sought for their value as food, while others are pursued for their fighting abilities or for the difficulty of pursuit.
  - paragraph: Big-game fish are bony saltwater fish such as tuna, tarpon, and billfish (sailfish, marlin and swordfish). In North America, anglers fish also for common snook, redfish, salmon, trout, bass, pike, catfish of several species, walleye, and muskellunge.
  - paragraph:
    - text: The smallest fish routinely sought by anglers are called panfish, because they can fit in a normal cooking pan. Examples are crappies, perch, rock bass, bluegills, and other sunfish. Panfish are often sought by younger anglers, at least partly due to the relative ease with which they can be caught. The foregoing description was excerpted from

They typically have a very distinctive coloring, with deep blue and purple on the face and gill cover, dark olive-colored bands down the side, and a fiery orange to yellow belly. The fish play a key role in the food chain, and are prey for bass, other sunfish, northern pike, walleye, and muskies. West Shores stocks these fish most years.

  - heading "ROUGH FISH" [ref=e58] [level=3]:
    - strong: ROUGH FISH
  - paragraph: Rough fish (or the slang trash fish or dirt fish) is a term used by U.S. state agencies and U.S. anglers to describe fish that are less desirable to sport anglers within a limited region. The term usually refers to larger fish species that are not commonly eaten, are too rare to be commonly encountered, or are not sought by anglers for sporting purposes.
  - paragraph: There is no standard list of rough fishes. A fish that is considered a rough fish in one region may be considered a desirable game and food fish in another, often due to cultural differences or simply tradition. For example, the common carp is considered an undesirable rough fish in the United States and Australia, but is the premier game fish of Europe and the single most important food fish across most of Asia. In the US, the longnose gar is considered a rough fish and undesirable nuisance in Ohio, but in Louisiana, it is considered tasty by many locals. Due to the many small bones, it is rarely filleted, but instead is usually rolled with seasonings into "gar balls" and fried.
  - paragraph:
    - text: Some rough fishes are are exotic species that have been transplanted into North American waters from other continents either intentionally or unintentionally (for example, the common carp). Other rough fishes are native species that can be confused with carp because they look similar (bigmouth buffalo, smallmouth buffalo, and suckers).
