  - paragraph: 2018 Lake Depth Contour Survey Map
  - paragraph: This map lacks a lake surface elevation benchmark that would allow comparison to the 2001 or 2020 hydrographic surveys, or to the 1111.5’ planned design elevation of the lake.

  - paragraph: BATHYMETRIC CHANGE ANALYSIS
  - paragraph: Bathymetry is the study of the underwater depth of ocean or lake floors.
  - paragraph: In the summer of 2020, the HOA contracted for a hydrographic survey and bathymetric change analysis by Stockwell Engineers (data collection) and TD2 Engineers (analysis). The purpose of this work was to collect an updated 2020 bathymetric dataset and compare it to the 2001 bathymetric dataset that collected as the construction of the lake was nearing completion.
  - paragraph: "The 2020 TD2 Engineer’s report states that, assuming the measurements are perfectly accurate for both surveys:"
  - paragraph: Median lake depth was 11.6’ in 2020 vs 11.5’ in 2001, a difference of 0.1’ (1-3/16”)
  - paragraph: "Based on the 881 coordinate cut/fill points surveyed, the average change was -0.086’ (about -1”) and the median change was: -0.002’ (about -1/4”)"
  - paragraph: "Change in lake volume between 2020 and 2001: 164,287 cubic yards lost, 141,174 cubic yards gained, for a total difference of 23,113 cubic yards lost (-0.006%)"
  - paragraph: "The report states: “In my professional opinion, given the accuracy tolerances of the hydrographic equipment, the data indicates no significant change in the lake volume between 2001 and 2020.”"
  - paragraph: In related verbal discussions, the TD2 engineer noted that West Shores is not exposed to the typical sources of sediment that would cause shallowing of a lake. As demonstrated by the flood conditions that surrounded the lake in 2019, the design of the perimeter bank around West Shores eliminates the usual risk of sand and other deposits from periodic river flooding that normally affects many lakes. Further, the fully developed status of the land surrounding the lake eliminates the usual risk of deposits from uncontrolled runoff that would otherwise be associated with undeveloped lots or undeveloped boundary areas. Accordingly, while shoreline maintenance and spot work is to be expected from time to time, there is no reason to believe that any signficant dredging will be necessary in the future.
