          <p className="text-lg">In addition to construction matters, the Covenants address certain major issues pertaining to lot owner&apos;s right to use of the HOA&apos;s lake. For example: Inboard, Inboard/Outboard, and Outboard motors are allowed. Air boats, Jet Powered Boats, Jet Powered Watercraft classified as Jet Skis, Wave Runners or any Jet Powered Personal Watercraft of any other brand, make or model, and Boats with above water exhaust systems are prohibited. Article III, paragraph 2(c).</p>

          <p className="text-lg">All boat docks . . . shall be within the Owner&apos;s side lot alignment as it extends to the 40 foot maximum allowed into the lake from the Owner&apos;s Lake Lot Line. [Boat lifts may have] white, tan or gray canopy covers, or a canopy color approved by the Association. Plans for docks, and for boat lifts, showing size, materials, colors and configuration, must be approved by the Design Review Board or Association prior to installation. Article 1, paragraph 29.</p>

          <p className="text-lg">Boat Houses are prohibited. Article 1, paragraph 30.</p>

          <p className="text-lg">An amendment of any of the foregoing provisions, like all Covenant amendments, would require approval of 75% of lot owners.</p>

          <p className="text-lg">The Covenants go on to authorize the adoption of Lake Rules to further govern boat types, lengths, motor sizes and safety concerns on the lake. Here is a link to a PDF of the amended and restated <a href="https://www.westshoreslake.com/File/Get/84aad5f8-cab0-4586-af76-feb64f55dc78" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 font-semibold">Lake Rules</a> in effect as of October of 2023. Unlike the Covenants, Amendments of Lake Rules require approval of only 50% of lot owners.</p>
